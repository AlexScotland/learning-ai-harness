"""The node contract — the contributor door for graph primitives.

A node is a small class with DECLARED PORTS and one method:

    def run(self, state, config) -> None

``state`` is the engine's NodeState for this node (see graph_loop.py):
  * ``state.get(type)``            — read a required input ('goal' is the graph input)
  * ``state.get_optional(type)``   — read an optional input (None if absent)
  * ``state.inputs()``             — (upstream node id, its outputs) in declared order
  * ``state.out(type, value)``     — record a typed output on the blackboard
  * ``state.agent`` / ``state.goal`` / ``state.conversation``
  * ``state.components``           — the per-turn component snapshot (slots)
  * ``state.ctx``                  — the ComponentContext (llm/tools/config/extras)

The v0 type set is CLOSED: context, goal, plan, result, verdict, merged, pass.
``goal`` needs no incoming edge — it is the resolved Goal of the turn.
``side_effects = True`` marks nodes that mutate the world/conversation;
they are rejected at build time inside ``parallel`` branches.

A node is a file + a registration — discovered through one door:
    registry.register_primitive("my_node", MyNode())
#tags graph-loop primitives contract contributor
