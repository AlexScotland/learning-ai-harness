"""merge — the ONLY committer of branch/parallel outputs to the conversation.

Contract (v0):
  requires:  (no typed require — it fans in whatever its declared input edges carry)
  provides:  'merged' (list, declared order), 'result' (joined text), 'context'
  rule:      commits its inputs to state.conversation IN DECLARED EDGE ORDER —
             this is what makes parallel fan-out deterministic (the engine runs
             branches concurrently, but their commits land here, serially, in order)
